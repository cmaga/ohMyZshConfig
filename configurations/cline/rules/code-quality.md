# Code Quality Standards

## Brief overview

Global code quality standards that apply across all projects.

## Standards

- Never use emojis anywhere in code or documentation - it is unprofessional
- Do not try to run apps or verify changes by hitting endpoints unless explicitly asked
- Solutions should be simple and elegant
